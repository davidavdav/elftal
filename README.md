Elftal
======

The project Elftal has a goal to produce a spoken language recogntion system.  We use it to make recognition system for the eleven official languages in South Africa. 

The goals is to write the bulk of the code in julia. 

The code thus far is very limited (see fea/).  We have
 - some [signal processing](https://github.com/davidavdav/SignalProcessing)
 - some feature extraction
 - [Gaussian Mixture Modeling](gmm/) (diagonal covariance)
=======
 - some [feature extraction](https://github.com/davidavdav/MFCCs) using Dan Ellis's [rastamat](https://github.com/davidavdav/Rasta)
 - diagonal covariance [Gaussian Mixture Modeling](https://github.com/davidavdav/GMMs)

The code has moved to the individual repositories above.  This is now just a placehalder, and may contain some overall scripts and results.
